# # Weather app for iOS #

In August 2016, I had to write a small weather app as part of the hiring process when I applied for a job at Kapaza. 

The app needed to show the weather in Brussels and the closest cities for the next three days. The first screen should display a list of all the places with the current weather situations. On clicking on these cities, another screen should display the current weather situation in more detail and the forecast for the next three days.
The data about the cities should be fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/current)

### What is this repository for? ###

My goal is to share the kind of code I write, or I would have written one year ago. It is also a simple way to store the code somewhere for me.

### How do I get set up? ###

Just download the project, run CocoaPods and replace the OpenWeatherMap key with yours.
